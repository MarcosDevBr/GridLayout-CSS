## About The Project

In this repository I will create a responsive CSS layout using the new CSS Grid Layout properties. With it you can create complex layouts using and still keep the HTML markup clean.
CSS Grid Layout is a new specification of CSS and it came to solve practically all the problems of positioning on the screen that exist. Based on this I will create a real project from scratch.
